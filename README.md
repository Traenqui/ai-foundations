# AI Foundations (HS24)

Welcome to my notes for **AI Foundations**. This course is centered around **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** concepts, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. These notes will cover what Iâ€™ve learned so far, along with some insights from the lectures, exercises, and mini-projects.

## Course Structure

Each week consists of:

- **Lectures**: Theoretical knowledge and key concepts.
- **Practical Exercises**: Python-based assignments to apply what you've learned.
- **Mini Projects**: Team-based projects to explore deeper AI applications, such as building chatbots, performing sentiment analysis, and implementing retrieval-augmented generation.

### Tools and Platforms:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for coding assignments and projects.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building neural networks and working with word embeddings.
- **OpenAI GPT API**: For exploring GPTs and agents.

## Resources

- **Textbook**: [Introduction to Probability](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Probability-Chapman-Statistical-Science/dp/1466575573) by J. Blitzstein & J. Hwang.
