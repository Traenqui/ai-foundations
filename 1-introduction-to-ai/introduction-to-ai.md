Lecture Date:: 2024-09-17

Instructors:: Marco Lehmann

Course:: AI Foundations

Week:: 1

## Course Goals

The primary objective of this course is to provide a string foundation in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Students will:

- Gain a high-level understanding of **what machine learning is** and how it works
- Learn the **different types of machine learning** (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning, etc.)
- Explore **typical AI applications** currently in use
- Navigate the **wide range of AI tools and techniques**
- Implement **elementary ML algorithms** and learn **how to work with data**
- Understand concepts like **optimization**, **validation** and **regularization** to improve ML models.
- Apply **advanced AI techniques** in state-of-the-art AI products

## Course Structure

- **Lectures**: 2 hours per week
- **Exercises**: 2 hours per week (critical to attend!)
- **Grading**:
  - 60% written exam (pen and paper, no computers)
  - 40% mini-project (document ideas, concepts, and implementation).

**Important**: Form project teams of 2 people (exceptions if the number of students is odd).

## Key Topics

### Part 1: History and Foundations of AI

- Overview of key developments leading to modern AI.
- Discussion of AI's impact on science, technology, and society.
- Introduction to the Turing Test and its implications for AI.
- A look at controversial AI topics.

### Part 2: Introduction to Data Handling in AI

- Learn how to load and explore data using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn.
- Introduction to the Conda environment for managing packages and dependencies.

## What is AI and Machine Learning?

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: A broad concept aiming to create machines that simulate human thought and behavior.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI focused on creating systems that learn from data without explicit programming.
  - **Statistical Machine Learning**: This course focuses on data-driven approaches, not rule-based systems.

> The ultimate goal of AI research is AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), a system that performs intellectual tasks as well as, or better than, humans.

## A Brief History of AI

- The origins of AI trace back to ancient myths about intelligent artificial beings. In modern times, AI began with symbolic logic and early computers.
- Key milestones:
  - **The Mechanical Turk**: A fraudulent chess-playing machine (1770), symbolizing early mechanical "intelligence."
  - **Ada Lovelace (1815-1852)**: The first computer programmer who saw beyond calculations and recognized the wider potential of machines.
  - **Dartmouth Workshop (1956)**: A foundational event in AI research. John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and others coined the term "AI."
  - **Alan Turing (1912-1954)**: Introduced the Turing Test to evaluate machine intelligence.
  - **Frank Rosenblatt (1957)**: Developed the Perceptron, a pioneering neural network concept.
  - **ELIZA (1966)**: The first chatbot to simulate human conversation using simple pattern matching.

## Modern AI Milestones

### Deep Learning Revolution

- The core of modern AI lies in artificial neural networks and deep learning, which can model complex non-linear functions.
- Backpropagation and optimization techniques were developed much earlier but became practical only recently with advances in hardware and data availability.

### Recent Wow Moments

- **2012**: AlexNet revolutionizes computer vision.
- **2014**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) emerge, allowing for high-quality image generation.
- **2016**: AlphaGo defeats Lee Sedol in Go, an unprecedented achievement in AI.
- **2021**: AlphaFold achieves breakthroughs in protein folding prediction, revolutionizing biology.
- **2022**: AI discovers new matrix multiplication methods with reinforcement learning, optimizing one of MLâ€™s core operations.

### AI in Popular Culture

- AI has influenced not just science but also fiction, such as Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics and the ethical dilemmas they present.

## Challenges and Ethical Considerations

**Recent discussions and warnings highlight the potential dangers of AI:**

- AI can exacerbate inequalities if not carefully regulated.
- AI has been used to generate dangerous technologies, such as chemical weapons.
- Key figures like Geoffrey Hinton warn about the misuse of AI, particularly in areas like misinformation and autonomous weapons.

**Discussion Questions**:

- How should AI be regulated to prevent harm?
- How can AI be used ethically in sensitive domains like healthcare or criminal justice?
- Who is responsible when AI systems make harmful decisions?

## Conclusion

The first lecture sets the stage for a deep exploration into AI and machine learning. From historical developments to cutting-edge breakthroughs, the course will cover the foundations and real-world applications of AI, while also encouraging students to think critically about the ethical implications and future directions of this rapidly evolving field.
